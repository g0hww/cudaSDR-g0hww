# cudaSDR-g0hww

A fork of VK5ABN's cudaSDR for fiddling with. 

Fork created with "git svn clone http://svn.tapr.org/repos_sdr_hpsdr/trunk/VK5ABN/cudaSDR" on development 'puter so I can hopefully keep this up-to-date with the svn upstream.

I don't have a compatible radio yet, so this is all untested, but it does build and run on Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64.

 * Master branch is currently pristine upstream from VK5ABN's svn repo.

 * Branch n1gp-local-sound includes local audio changes from https://github.com/n1gp/cudaSDR
